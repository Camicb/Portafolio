# PORTFOLIO

 This file summarizes some of the personal projects I'm working on. It's still under construction, so it can be updated at any time, along with the projects.

## Project 1: Copper Price Forecasting
The objective of this project is to forecast the worldwide price of copper (metal). In Chile, there are 26 mining deposits that produce 5.7 million tons of copper per year, which represents 28% of world production. This relative abundance of copper has made it the main export of Chile and therefore its contribution is vital to the Chilean economy. Anticipating the price of copper allows the estimation of the profitability of related projects and their viability over time.

The project is divided into 2 parts: Part 1 only considers dates and prices as variables, and Part 2 considers prices along with the values of other commodities. Data for both parts were collected by myself. More information about this project can be found [here](https://github.com/Camicb/Copper-Forecasting).

***Skills**: Data extraction, Data Cleaning, Data Visualization*

***Stack**: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), Facebook Prophet, ARIMA models, Tableau*

***Domain**: Time-series, financial markets*

NOTE: It is important to consider that this project does not constitute a guide for investing or to make financial decisions, the focus here is entirely for learning purposes.

## Project 2: Travel Insurance Claim Prediction

Many companies selling tickets or travel packages, give consumers the option to purchase travel insurance, also known as travelers insurance. Travel insurance is a type of insurance that covers the costs and losses associated with traveling. It is useful protection for those traveling domestically or abroad. Some travel policies cover damage to personal property, rented equipment, such as rental cars, or even the cost of paying a ransom.

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model for an insurance company to predict if the insurance buyer will claim their travel insurance or not.

This project was part of an assignment for a Machine Learning Bootcamp conducted by [DPhi](https://dphi.tech/) that I took last year. The datasets were provided freely by them.

In the [first version](https://github.com/Camicb/practice-1/blob/main/Travel_Insurance_Claim_Prediction.ipynb) of this project, I experimented with traditional classification models, and the results weren't so good, so in the [second version](https://github.com/Camicb/Anomaly-detection/blob/main/v2_Travel_Insurance_Claim_Prediction.ipynb) I tried more elaborate techniques.

NOTE: the results for both versions of this project were bad because of the data quality, but I wanted to include them as a project here as a reminder that sometimes it is better to collect new data instead of trying more complicated approaches.

***Skills**: Data Visualization, Data Cleaning, Oversampling, Feature Engineering, Autoencoders*

***Stack**: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikitplot), Pycaret, Scikit-learn, Tensorflow 2, Keras, SMOTE*

***Domain**: Anomaly Detection, Classification*
